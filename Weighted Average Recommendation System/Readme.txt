This is a Weighted Average Recommendation System.
So what is main intuition behind this type of Recommendation System-
It shows the movies or things to user based on the score obtained by combining the popularity/score given by user and the no. of
votes given to each movies and hence it calculates the weighted score of each and every movie.

Formula used - W(weighted score)= (R*v+C*m)/(v+m)
where R=average score
v=no of votes 
C=Mean vote across whole set 
m=minimum vote required to be in top 200
